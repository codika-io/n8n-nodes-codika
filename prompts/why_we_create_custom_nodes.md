I recently started creating Codika nodes because we are Codika is a platform where we automate the creation of workflows inside Any10, and we couple those workflows with our own infrastructure that is in GCP. Basically, we have a platform where we help users do that. The idea is that we have agents that will build the use cases for the clients, and so clients never actually interact with Any10. We have a special guide that explains to an agent how to build a certain use case. What I noticed is that recently I learned how we can create our own custom nodes inside Any10, and I see a very big potential of us creating Codika nodes so that we can make the overall process of creating use cases easier. The reason is that in all of our use cases, there are some parts that are similar. I think those similar parts would result in some sort of duplicate code over all the different workflows, and it makes more sense to create special nodes that contain all of that logic. That can be used directly. It will both reduce the amount of notes used in our workflows and it will also simplify the overall code because the logic will be in the nodes that we create.
Here are the nodes we created :
